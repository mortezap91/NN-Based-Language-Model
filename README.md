# NN Language Model

This repository contains a basic implementation of a Neural Network-Based Language Model. The model is designed to predict the next word in a sentence using neural networks.

Main Features
Model: Uses RNN, LSTM, and GRU to predict the next word in a sequence.
Data: Text data is preprocessed into a format suitable for training.
Training: The model is trained using different strategies to improve accuracy.
Evaluation: Accuracy of predictions is measured on test data.
